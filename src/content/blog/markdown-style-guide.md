## Image

![A deer with its head resting on its back. The animal has a brown fur coat and long ears, and it appears to be standing in an outdoor setting. Its snout is visible, as well as the white markings around its eyes.](../../assets/blog/markdown-style-guide/example-image.jpg)

## Table

This is technically not a table anymore. To make it completely responsive, I applied `display: block` and `overflow-x: auto` on the `table` element.

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

## Fenced code block

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
